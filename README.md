# PPI-MD-Analysis
Codes for computing averages of protein-protein complexes structural properties along molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories.
This repository contains three C source codes to compute the averages of root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square-fluctuaction (RMSF) and interfacial area of protein-protein complexes over the course of MD simulations.
