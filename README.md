Codes for computing averages of protein-protein complexes structural properties along MD trajectories
This repository contains three C source codes to compute the root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square-fluctuaction (RMSF) and interfacial area of protein-protein complexes over the course of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
